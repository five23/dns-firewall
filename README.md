<STRONG>DNS Firewall - Block Ads, Trackers and Malicious stuff using DNS</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
DNS files to block ads, trackers and malicious stuff from the web/internet. Use with your local DNS Server to prevent resolution to questionalble, annoying and possible dangerous sources.
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Disclaimer</STRONG>: These files are generated automatically, unduplicated, aggregrated and are provided as is. Some thougth and filtering went into the process to have as less false-positives as possible, but depends on sources used (see <a HREF="https://github.com/cbuijs/dns-firewall/blob/master/sources.list">"sources.list"</a> file). By no means these lists are complete and do not guarantee an error-free or disrupted-free experience when used in any way. Use at own risk!
<BR><BR>
The lists provides two type of items for filtering: "Domains" and "Hosts". When a "Domain" is mentioned, it designates the domain and all sub-domains and "Host" just a specific host (FQDN). For best filtering results, both needs to be incorparated together. The most complete filtering set is <A HREF="https://dnsrpz.info/">RPZ based</A>. See <A HREF="http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch7/rpz.html">here</A> how to setup with ISC BIND.
<BR><BR>
Where applicable, there are two types of lists: "Block" (Filter) and "Unblock" (Do Not Filter).
<BR><BR>
The main categories that are pulled from the sources are: Advertising, Cyber-Attacks, Fake-News/Info, Gambling, Intrusion/Privacy, Malicious/Malware, Phising, Pornography and Tracking. Again, this is not an exact science as everything is merged in one big list with the idea to avoid as much as possible any annoyance.
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> This is a work-in-progress and mistakes/erros/faults will creep in from time to time. The lists ere updated at least once very 24 hours. This is done by an automated process, which can fail. See disclaimer at the top.
